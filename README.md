Wizards AI 

This is meant to be a form of compliment to the Wizards of the Coast website. 
The way it works is using the Gemini API and does require some knowledge of the actual games. The steps to using the code are as follows:
1. Launch the program and it will show a screen with two buttons one leading to the deck builder and one to the character builder.
2. Pick one of the two options
   a If the character creator was picked simply input the class and the race that you'd like to play as and the AI will generate a sample character sheet
   1b If deck builder was chosen it will send you to a frame that will force you to choose which format you'd like to play
   2b. Pick the format and from there input the color combination and the play style.
